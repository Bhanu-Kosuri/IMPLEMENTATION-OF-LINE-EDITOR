LINE EDITOR PROJECT: 
This project is a Line Editor built in C++, using data structures to store and manipulate text lines and file-handling to load and save contents. 
The editor allows inserting new lines, deleting existing ones, editing a line, displaying the full text, and saving/loading from a file, providing a simple yet functional text editing interface.
It uses dynamic memory management and linked-list to maintain the lines in memory and persists changes via file I/O.

Compile the program: g++ *.cpp or g++ *.cpp -o LineEditor

Run the program: ./a.out or ./LineEditor
